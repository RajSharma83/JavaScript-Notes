# JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my **JavaScript Learning Journey**!  

This repository contains my **notes, practice exercises, and small projects** as I learn JavaScript from the basics to more advanced concepts. 
It's a personal collection where I experiment with code, solve problems, and build a stronger foundation in JavaScript.

## What you will find here
- Core JavaScript concepts (variables, functions, loops, arrays, objects)
- DOM manipulation and events
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, template literals, etc.)
- Practice exercises and coding challenges
- Mini projects and experiments

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to **document my learning**, practice coding regularly, and create a **resource I can refer back to** as I improve my JavaScript skills.
